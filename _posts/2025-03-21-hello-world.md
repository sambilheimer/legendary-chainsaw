# Hello, World!

Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post, created with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. Wow.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a simple platform where I could:

1. Write content in Markdown
2. Version control my posts with Git
3. Deploy easily with GitHub Pages

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Technology
- Projects I'm working on
- Interesting things I've learned

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
